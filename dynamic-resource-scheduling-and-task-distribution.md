# Dynamic Resource Scheduling & Task Distribution

**Dynamic Resource Scheduling Engine**

* **AI-driven Supply and Demand Matching**: TixonEdge uses historical data to predict resource demand (e.g., peak computing demand during midday) and dynamically schedules resources accordingly. For example, based on past usage patterns, the system can predict higher demand during specific hours and preemptively schedule edge nodes into standby mode.
* **Real-time Bidding Market**: When a task is posted by a resource demander (e.g., an AI company), they can attach a token bid. Nodes compete for tasks based on their hardware cost (e.g., electricity), and smart contracts automatically select the lowest bidder.

**Anti-Low-Quality Service Penalty**

Nodes must stake tokens to participate in tasks. If a node fails to meet performance standards (e.g., excessive computation time or error rates), it will be penalized, and a portion of the staked tokens will be distributed to affected users. This penalty system incentivizes nodes to provide high-quality services and ensures the network's stability.
