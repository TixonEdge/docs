# Competitive Advantages

**Cost Revolution**

By using decentralized LightNodes instead of centralized cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS servers), TixonEdge drastically reduces hardware and operational costs.

**Privacy Compliance**

TixonEdge employs privacy-enhancing technologies such as TEE and differential privacy to ensure that sensitive data never leaves the local device and complies with regulations like GDPR and CCPA.

**Ecosystem Interoperability**

TixonEdge supports cross-DePIN project resource sharing, allowing, for example, energy data from the SolarMesh network to be sold directly to TixonEdge for training carbon-neutral AI models.
